          looked into issue in new entries where all builds were saying they could update even though some couldn't

          looked into issue where new builds were being assigned the wrong author name (sorry)

          looked into issue where for some people it would continously fail to send stats after build install

          looked into download stats not counting on total downloads

          bundled both required modules within main zip.. may prevent dependancies not met issues

          tweaked stats\listings to make it more efficient.. (hopefully, lol)

          NEW FEATURE:  glad to say the backup feature is done, hope it helps ;)

          Browse Builds revamp.. you can now easily view the top 20 builds [from the previous week], new entries and assorted builds

          Increased GUI size, now runs full screen..little bit more space.

          added news ticker to bottom of screen

          added a label underneath big lists to indicate current selection and number of items in the list, (ie.. 1/10) hopefully this will make scrolling easier

          the yellow arrows now also hide when at the end of a list.

          tweaked error reporting on downloads

          fixed issue where when changelog is still in the background, install button etc didn't show

          lists now return to their orignal postions when browsing addons\builds etc.. will save a bit of scrolling ;)

          shifted a few labels to avoid overlapping with non-standard fonts.

          fixed ratings
